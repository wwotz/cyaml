# cyaml - A YAML (not quite) parser written in C.

## What is it
This is a YAML (not quite) parser, it is only a subset of the YAML
syntax that I find important enough for my particular use case. It
implements the ability to have a key-value pair, and a key associated
with a list. These particular features are the only useful features that
I need when writing YAML configuration files.
